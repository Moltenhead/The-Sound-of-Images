# The Sound of Images
Trying to produce sounds, based on images

## Working On :
* Most of the basics are good, there is incompatibility between XYZ converter and wavelength table though
   * need to find what is the true problem (from converter or from relying on a nm by nm only table)
   
## Features Needed:
* modular image "shrinker" to avoid passing through hundred thousands of pixels
